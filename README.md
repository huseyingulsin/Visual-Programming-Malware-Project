# Visual-Programming Course / Malware-Project
I prepared a simple malware simulation for educational purposes for the Visual Programming(BIL3113) course in the department of Computer Science at Dokuz Eylul University.

I am going to add:
- Windows Form for a simple interface
- More functionality to be  a root user in the background.
